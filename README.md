# hello-world
Hi, my name is Tran. I'm an 18 year old soon-to-be freshman at Seattle Central College. I love all kinds of music genres but prefer rock (mostly heavy metal or indie) Recently, I've used this passion for music which led me to an internship at a local radio station. Hopefully I'll have a career in music, communications, and psychology. If not all at once, one of them is fine too ;)
